# Calculator with React  :paperclip:

This is a solo project as part of the Microverse curriculum, it is a simple react application where I built a real-world project for a fictional company that is about building a calculator and has different milestones and some technical requirements to follow. 

```  
Math-magicians is a fictional company based in France. They have requested your help to 
build a simple product that would assist them with their calculations. An important thing to 
notice is that they have asked for a product that is not just fully-functional, 
but also beautiful and user-friendly.
```
